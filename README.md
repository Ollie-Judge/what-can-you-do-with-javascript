## Design

#### Colour
The colour will be consistent over all pages, i will use a turquois colour for the buttons and the ncontrast that against a tan background, i think these colours will give the site a fun and creative look as these colours are not used very often.

The typeography will be plain and simple, one that is easy to read and doesnt distract from what is being shown off, such as san-serif.

There will be no imported images as that is not what this website needs nor uses
